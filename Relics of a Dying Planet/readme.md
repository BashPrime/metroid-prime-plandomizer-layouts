# Relics of a Dying Planet

Samus wakes up to find that she passed out on Tallon IV. This wouldn't be a big deal, but she was unconscious for an unfathomably long time. The planet has become nearly uninhabitable, with some areas having been sealed away - Tallon Overworld's lakes have dried up, Magmoor's volcanic activity has all but ceased, the Chozo Ruins have almost completely been lost to time, and Phendrana Drifts is still as cold and desolate as ever. Will Samus overcome and escape this hostile planet, or will she fail?

# Features
- A completely shifted around early game. Nearly all of the water (and some lava) has been drained from Tallon IV, making some areas considerably more accessible than usual!
- As far as I am aware, the only risk of softlocking is at the very beginning of the game in one room.
- A challenging early game due to initial lack of resources, with a challenging lategame section that demands as many resources as you can collect in the interim.

# Techniques

## Required
- Double Bomb Jumps in early game
- Without getting too much into spoilers, the more Energy Tanks you find for the lategame, the better.
- Patience.

## Not Required
- Out of Bounds
- Infinite Speed
- Advanced Bomb Jumps
